       <h2>Uncharted Planet Game Review</h2>
       
       <p class="intro">The game Uncharted Planet is a Sci-Fi game in which you are attempting to find notes on an unknown planet. This article will give an overall review of the game and its features.</p>
       
       <h3>Start Screen:</h3>
       
       <p class="intro">The start screen is simple and easy. It has a background image of a ship and the forest that the game takes place in. There are four buttons to choose from on the main menu: "Start Search" is simply the start button to begin plaing the game; Then "Credits" which takes you to the credits screen, "Controls" takes you to a new screen showing the controls of the game. To move you use the WASD keys, you use Shift to sprint, and your mouse to look around. Then finaly the fourth button is "Abort Search" which is how you exit the game.</p>

       <h3>Characters and Plot:</h3>
       
       <p class="intro">You start the game in a strange environment. You look around and see a landed spacecraft of somesort next to you. It's dark and storming and you are in a forest. The sky above you is purpleish and the environment gives you a very uneasy feeling. The leaves on the trees are blowing in the wind and it's storming. On the screen there is a compas and a box in the top left corner with text in it. Here we are introduced to our characters in the game, Jonas Quinn and David Romando. The Note in the top corner is the first log that in the game. This one, written by Jonas, lets the player know he was sent yo the planet by David's family to find him. So the search begins. The compas in the bottom right hand corner of the screen points you to the next log you need to find. Now the player must walk in the diretion the compas is pointing to the next log that shows up as a blue glowing light coming from the ground. To interact with it you simply walk into the light. When you do so you get a new log in the top left hand corner to read and the compas starts pointing to the location of the next log. These logs give us the context to the plot of the game. The story is that David Romando had gone missing and his family is paying a man named Jonas Quinn to find him. We learn that David had crash landed on the planet and didn't know where he was. He sent out a distress signal but no one gets it. David had survived off of berries and dead animals for a while; however there is dried blood on Davids final log and it is obvious that David had myseriously died on the planet. After you find this last log Jonas decides he has answers for Davids family and is ready to head back home. The compas then points toward your landed ship where you had started in the begining and when you arrive at the space shuttle the game ends.</p>

       <h3>Environment and Graphics:</h3>
       
       <p class="intro">As I talked about above the Environment is a forest on some alien planet. It is dark and stormy and you can see the branches on the trees blowing violently in the wind, giving the game a spooky and uneasy feel. It almost seems like you are on Earth if it wasn't for the purple colored sky. The terrain is overall flat except for the hills surrounding the map to bound the player in. The grass is tall and overgrown. On top of the creepy environment the games music also gives off a very spooky sci-fi vibe. As you look around your character shines a light in the direction of your gaze to help iluminate your path. The graphics are pretty simple but effective. There are a few variants of trees all with bark textures. The leaves move in the wind and the sky shows some stars and clouds. The world is pretty repetative and is just a big forest.</p>

       <h3>Overall Thoughts:</h3>
       
       <p class="intro">Overall the game was interesting but simple. At times I wished there was more to the forest to explore other than the repetative trees and grass. The only "objects" in the game were the logs and the ship and you barely interacted with either one. The only interaction you had was walking up to the objects and reading the logs. I feel like allowing the player to pick up the log up by hitting a button or interacting with the ship would have made for a slightly more immersive experience. I also wanted more to discover and see while searching for the logs. If there was more to discover or see than the logs it would give the player more to do. The game was rather easy and after I quickly figured out the compas I was able to easily find the logs without challenge or conflict. However, even though the game may be simple the ambiance of he game gives you an intense feeling in your stomach. The music, story, and location of the game gives the player a constant mood of mystery and curiosity that truely draws you in. I found that as I found more logs it only made me yearn more and more for answers to what had happened to David. In the end it stole my attention and Ii enjoyed discovering the new and exciting world that the game "Uncharted Planet" creates.</p>
