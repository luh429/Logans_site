            <p class="intro">For my Corpus Analysis assignment I chose two Dr. Seuss books. The Cat in the Hat and Green Eggs and Ham. To compare the texts I use both Voyant Tools and AntConc. What I found is that the two books surprisingly don't have a lot of common word choice.</p>
            
            <p class="intro">First looking at the books in Voyant Tools it was very difficult to find any words that the texts commonly used. Starting with The Cat in The Hat the top word was “said” used 39 times. Then after that were character names like “cat” and “fish”. This shows that most of the story is dialogue considering the word “said” is the most used word. Then also that the main characters talking are the Cat in the Hat and the Fish. Something I found interesting was the children in the story were not really represented through the words in Voyant Tools, because the story is told from their point of view. So anytime the text was referring to the kids it used the term “we” which is blocked through Voyant’s stopwords. Otherwise the word “we” would have been the third most common word.</p>

            <p class="intro">Then I looked at Green Eggs and Ham in Voyant Tools. The number one word was “like” with 44 uses. The second most common word was the character's name “Sam” followed by “green”, “eggs”, and “ham” all with 12 uses. The fact the “green”, “eggs”, and “ham” were all in the top few words wasn’t surprising considering it is the title of the book and it is the main topic of the story. The fact that “Sam” is the second most common word shows that once again the characters in Dr. Suess’s stories talk and are mentioned a lot. Also the character talking to Sam in the story was not represented in Voyant Tools much like the children in The Cat in the Hat. However the character talking to Sam is simply not mentioned at all in the text. He just speaks but the reader doesn’t really know who he is.</p>

            <p class="intro">Then I moved into AntConc. The first thing I noticed when looking at The Cat in the Hat was that “said the cat” and “said the fish” were in the top 5 ranked N-Grams when I set the N-Gram size to 3. This further supports my earlier thoughts about the story being a large part dialogue between the cat and the fish. The other top N-Grams were “the cat in the hat” with a word or two taken off either end. So I then set the N-Gram size up to 5 and the number 1 N-Gram was “the cat in the hat” used 10 times which is not surprising considering it is the title of the book. It also seems that Dr. Suess used the name of the books he wrote within the text of the book quite often. I then looked at how “the cat in the hat” was being used in the text and in most cases it was used then the Cat was saying something. So it was commonly preceded by the most commonly single word used “said”.</p>

            <figure class="AnalysisPictures">  <img class="GalleryPhoto1" src="images/Green_Eggs_and_Ham_IDoNotLikeThem.PNG" alt="Green Eggs and Ham i do not like them"/> <p>Green Eggs and Ham "i do not like them"</p> </figure>
            
            <p class="intro">Then I looked at Green Eggs and Ham in AntConc. I started once again by setting the N-gram size to 3. The top three N-Grams were all a part of the phrase “I do not like them”.  So I then turned the N-Gram size up to 5 again and sure enough the number 1 N-Gram was “I do not like them” used 25 times. I then looked in AntConc to see how the phrase was used in the text and it was almost always referring in some way to not liking green eggs and ham. Which was not in any way surprising considering that is the title of the book. Then I was curious how often the title “Green Eggs and Ham” was used in the text so I set the N-Gram size to 4. I found that “green eggs and ham” was the third most commonly used N-Gram. This helped contribute to my hypothesis that Dr. Suess books commonly have their title within their text.</p>

            <p class="intro">The Only N-Gram I saw in the top 13 of both books was “i do not”. Ranking number 2 most common in Green Eggs and Ham and number 7 in The Cat in the Hat.</p>
            
            <p class="intro">In conclusion the two texts I looked at had a few things in common. For example some of the main characters being very commonly mentioned in the story while some of the other main characters not being represented very much if at all. Also both books used their title in the text pretty frequently. However the books didn’t have very many words or phrases in common except for “i do not”.</p>
            
            <p class="intro">I also briefly looked at a few other Dr. Suess books and I found common patterns in the text. However I found that some of the other Dr.Seuss books used a lot of the same words and phrases as Green Eggs and Ham. So it almost seems like The Cat in the Hat might have a unique word selection in comparison to some of the other Dr. Suess books. If I were going to continue to look deeper into this I would try to get a lot of Dr. Suess books and compare them all together to see overall patterns in his writing.</p>
