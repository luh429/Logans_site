            <p class="More">My first main assignment of my DIGIT 100 class was to create two websites. One on WordPress and one on Github. Going into this assignment I didn’t know what to expect as I had never worked with website development before, let alone coding. With that said I was a little nervous but I am excited about the things I have learned.</p>
                
            <p class="More">I started With Github, knowing pretty much nothing about what it was. I thought coding would be complicated and hard to understand but before long I started to get the hang of it. I really liked how I was able to manipulate everything about my website down to the smallest detail. Unfortunately it could easily become tedious and overwhelming at times. I liked the ability to get exactly what I wanted from the coding but didn’t necessarily enjoy the amount of time it took to manipulate the code and the styling. It was also frustrating at times when the code wouldn’t work how I expected it to; however it was satisfying when I would figure out the solution to my problem.</p>
                
            <p class="More">Then I moved onto this WordPress page. Once again I found things that I both liked and disliked about the creation process. WordPress gave me a quicker way to create a page but I often found myself wanting things to look slightly different. It was a lot faster and simpler to build the page but I found myself longing for the complexity of that allowed me to place things down just how I wanted them. Sure it got the job done but I just felt like I got more pride frome completing the page on Github.</p>
                
            <p class="More">In the end both websites have their uses but I prefer Github. If I was in a hurry and needed a quick website that looks nice I would use WordPress. However when it comes to making a website that I truly want to put time and effort into, I would use Github for its infinite ability to customize and create exactly what I want for my website.</p>
